# DJANGO DECORATORS

## What is a decorator in python?
It is a design pattern, which allows us to modify behaviour of a function or class.

## Why decorators are required?
1. A decorated is required when we want to modify a function without modifying the function itself.
2. Can also be used when we need to run the same code on multiple functions.
3. Example: Adding logs, testing performance, perform caching, authentication, permissions etc.

## Things to know
1. Decorators are also caller <b>wrapper/wrapper function</b>.
2. The function which is decorated is called <b>wrapped function</b>.
