# DJANGO DECORATORS

## What is a decorator in python?
It is a design pattern, which allows us to modify behaviour of a function or class.

## Why decorators are required?
1. A decorater is required when we want to modify a function without modifying the function itself.
2. Can also be used when we need to run the same code on multiple functions.
3. Example: Adding logs, testing performance, perform caching, authentication, permissions etc.

## Things to know
1. Decorators are also caller <b>wrapper/wrapper function</b>.
2. The function which is decorated is called <b>wrapped function</b>.
3. Python treats functions as <b>first class objects</b> which means python supports the concept of First Class functions. We will learn about this.
4. This leads to many powerful ways to use functions.

### What is first class function?
"An entity that can be constructed at run-time, passed as a parameter, returned from a function, or assigned into a variable."

### Properties of first class functions
1. A function is an instance of the Object type.
2. Functions can be stored in variables.
3. Functions can be passed as arguments in another function.
4. A function can be returned from a function.
5. Functions can be stored in data structures such as hash tables, lists etc.
